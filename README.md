Single-page HTML/JS that shows how badly inflation has wrecked your income

To render the output file ('rendered.html', git ignored), run
```sh
./BUILD/inflation_calc.py
```

This will render the HTML/JS/CSS into a single minified file in the root directory.


Note that you may need to `pip install -r BUILD/requirements.txt` first.
