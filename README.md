# WhyDoIFeelBroke.com
Single-page HTML/JS/CSS that shows how badly inflation has wrecked your income. Fully works for 
the United States of America, has limited features/data for South Africa.


## Requirements
Node/NPM is required for this.


To install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Building

To render the output file ('rendered.html', git ignored), run
```sh
./BUILD/inflationCalc.js
```

This will render the HTML/JS/CSS into a single minified file in the `dist/` directory.
