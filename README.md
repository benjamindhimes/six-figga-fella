Single-page HTML/JS that shows how badly inflation has wrecked your income

Node/NPM is required for this.


To install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

To render the output file ('rendered.html', git ignored), run
```sh
./BUILD/inflationCalc.js
```

This will render the HTML/JS/CSS into a single minified file in the root directory.
